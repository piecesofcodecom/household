# Household RPG
Welcome to the unofficial implementation of the Household RPG for Foundry VTT.

**Household RPG** is a trademark of Two Little Mice. This system includes all the dice rolls and character sheets you need, but to access the complete rules and item lists, you'll need to purchase the official books. For more details, visit [Two Little Mice](https://twolittlemice.net/).

If you're new to **Household RPG**, a quickstart guide is available [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421014/household-quickstart).
